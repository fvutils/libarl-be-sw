# Core code structure
- Co-routines for actions and exec blocks
- Functions default to blocking (non-coroutine)
- Component-tree structure
- 

# Activity support
- if/else
- match
- repeat

##
- Component DS and init
  - 
  - exec_init_down / exec_init_up as static-virtual methods
  - Assume static knowledge of inheritance relationships
